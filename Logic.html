        <h1>Introduction to Logic</h1>
        <p>Logic is the foundation of clear and rational thinking. It helps us distinguish between good and bad reasoning, recognize fallacies, and construct sound arguments. Without logic, discussions can become confusing, misleading, or even manipulative.
        <br>
At its core, logic is about <b>structure</b>—understanding how ideas connect and whether they lead to valid conclusions. It’s used in philosophy, mathematics, computer science, law, and everyday decision-making.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> From analyzing political arguments to evaluating scientific claims, logic plays a crucial role in helping us navigate the world.
        <br>
This section will introduce you to the fundamentals of logical reasoning, explore common fallacies, and show how logic applies to daily life. Whether you're interested in philosophy, debate, or just want to think more clearly, mastering logic is an essential skill.</p>

        <h3>1. What Is Logic?</h3>
        <p>Logic is the study of reasoning and argumentation. It focuses on how we can determine whether an argument is valid and sound, ensuring that the conclusions we reach are supported by solid evidence and reasoning.<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>
        <br>
At its most basic, logic provides <b>rules and principles</b> that help us distinguish between good and bad arguments. These rules are universal, applying across different fields like science, law, mathematics, and even everyday conversations.</p>
        <h4>Why Is Logic Important?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It helps us <b>avoid deception</b> by identifying weak or misleading arguments.</li>
            <li>It <b>strengthens our reasoning,</b> making us better at problem-solving and decision-making.</li>
            <li>It allows us to <b>communicate more effectively</b>, ensuring our arguments are clear and well-structured.</li>
            <li>It provides the foundation for <b>critical thinking</b>, an essential skill in academic, professional, and personal life.<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>By studying logic, we become better equipped to engage in meaningful discussions, spot inconsistencies, and think more rationally about the world around us.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>2. Statements & Arguments</h3>
        <p>To understand logic, we need to distinguish between <b>statements</b> and <b>arguments</b>.</p>
        <h4>What Is a Statement?</h4>
        <p>A <b>statement</b> is any sentence that expresses a fact or claim and can be classified as either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"The Earth revolves around the Sun." (True)</li>
            <li>"2 + 2 = 5." (False)</li>
            <li>"I like pizza." (This is true or false depending on the speaker.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Questions, commands, and exclamations (e.g., “What time is it?” or “Close the door!”) are <b>not</b> statements because they don’t express something that can be judged as true or false.</p>
        <h4>What Is an Argument?</h4>
        <p>An <b>argument</b> is a set of statements where some (called <b>premises</b>) are used to support another statement (the <b>conclusion</b>).</p>
        <p>Example of a simple argument:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Premise 1: All humans are mortal.</li>
            <li>Premise 2: Socrates is a human.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup></li>
        </ol>
        <p>A <b>valid</b> argument is one where, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. However, validity alone doesn’t guarantee truth—the premises themselves must also be true for an argument to be <b>sound</b>.</p>
        <p>Understanding statements and arguments is the first step in mastering logical reasoning.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
<h3>3. Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning</h3>
<p>There are two main types of reasoning in logic: <b>deductive</b> and <b>inductive</b>. Each serves a different purpose and has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h4>Deductive Reasoning: The Path to Certainty</h4>
<p>Deductive reasoning moves from <b>general principles</b> to <b>specific conclusions</b>. If the premises are true and the argument is valid, the conclusion <b>must</b> be true.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Premise:</b> All mammals have lungs.</li>
  <li><b>Premise:</b> A whale is a mammal.</li>
  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Therefore, a whale has lungs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Deductive reasoning is often used in <b>mathematics, logic, and philosophy</b>, where absolute certainty is required.</p>
<h4>Inductive Reasoning: The Path to Probability</h4>
<p>Inductive reasoning moves from <b>specific observations</b> to <b>general conclusions</b>. It doesn’t guarantee certainty but instead suggests that a conclusion is <b>likely</b> to be true.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every swan I’ve seen is white.</li>
  <li>Therefore, all swans are probably white.</li>
</ol>
<p>Inductive reasoning is used in <b>science, statistics, and everyday decision-making</b>, where conclusions are based on patterns and probabilities rather than absolute truths.<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Both forms of reasoning are essential, helping us navigate everything from scientific research to daily life.

  <h3>4. Common Logical Fallacies</h3>
  <p>A <b>fallacy</b> is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid or misleading. Learning to recognize fallacies is crucial for avoiding faulty logic and identifying weak arguments in debates, media, and everyday discussions.</p>
  <p>Here are some common fallacies:</p>
  <h4>Strawman Fallacy</h4>
  <p>Misrepresenting someone’s argument to make it easier to attack.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: Person A: "We should have better regulations for gun ownership."</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Person B: "Person A wants to take away all our guns!"</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4>Ad Hominem</h4>
  <p>Attacking the person making the argument instead of addressing their reasoning.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: "You can't trust her opinion on climate change; she's not a scientist."</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>False Dilemma</h4>
  <p>Presenting two choices as the only possibilities when others exist.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: "You’re either with us or against us."</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Slippery Slope</h4>
  <p>Claiming that a small step will inevitably lead to an extreme, undesirable outcome.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: "If we allow online voting, soon elections will be entirely rigged."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By recognizing these fallacies, we can better analyze arguments and avoid being misled.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>5. Symbolic Logic (Intro)
</h3>
<p>Symbolic logic uses <b>symbols and formulas</b> to represent logical statements, making it easier to analyze arguments precisely.</p>
<h4>Basic Symbols in Logic:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>P, Q, R</b> → Statements (e.g., P = "It is raining")</li>
  <li><b>∧ (and)</b> → "P ∧ Q" means both statements are true.</li>
  <li><b>∨ (or)</b> → "P ∨ Q" means at least one is true.</li>
  <li>→ <b>(if-then)</b> → "P → Q" means "If P is true, then Q must be true."</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If P = "It is raining" and Q = "The ground is wet,"</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"P → Q" means "If it is raining, then the ground is wet."</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Symbolic logic is widely used in <b>mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence</b>, providing a precise language for reasoning.</p>
</section>
<h3>6. Why Logic Matters</h3>
<p>Logic isn’t just an academic subject—it has real-world applications in every aspect of life.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>In Everyday Conversations:</b> Helps us communicate more clearly and avoid misunderstandings.</li>
  <li><b>In Debates and Politics:</b> Allows us to spot weak arguments and think critically about policies.</li>
  <li><b>In Science and Technology:</b> Forms the foundation of programming, AI, and scientific reasoning.</li>
  <li><b>In Decision-Making:</b> Helps us weigh options rationally rather than being swayed by emotions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world full of misinformation, logical thinking is a powerful tool for understanding reality and making better choices.</p>
