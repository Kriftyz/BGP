  <h1>What Is Philosophy?</h1>
  <p>At some point, we all ask big questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the meaning of life?</li>
    <li>How do we know what’s real?</li>
    <li>What makes something right or wrong?</li>
    <li>Do we have free will, or is everything predetermined?</li>
  </ul>
  <article>
  <p>Philosophy isn’t just about abstract ideas or ancient texts—it’s about <b>how we think, what we believe, and why we believe it</b>. It’s the study of <b>knowledge, existence, ethics, and reason</b>, helping us understand the world and our place in it.

But philosophy isn’t locked away in universities or buried in old books. It’s everywhere. It’s in <b>the movies we watch, the choices we make, the debates we have, and even the technologies we create</b>. Whether you realize it or not, you're already engaging with philosophy every time you question something, challenge an assumption, or try to make sense of a complex issue.
