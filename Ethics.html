  <h1>Introduction to Ethics</h1>
  <p>What does it mean to live a good life? What makes something right or wrong? Are moral rules universal, or do they change based on culture and circumstances?</p>
  <p>Ethics is the branch of philosophy that explores how we should act, what it means to be a good person, and whether morality is something objective or subjective. It’s not just about abstract debates—it’s about real-life decisions, from personal choices to global issues like justice, human rights, and the environment.</p>
  <p>Ethical questions shape laws, politics, relationships, and society itself. They influence everything from medical practices to business conduct. And whether we realize it or not, we use ethical reasoning every single day when we decide what’s right or wrong.</p>
  <p>In this section, we’ll explore the major ethical theories, real-world dilemmas, and the biggest questions about morality.</p>

    <h2>1. What Is Morality?</h2>
    <p>Morality is the system of values and principles that guide how people behave. But where does it come from? Is it something humans create, or is it built into the universe?</p>
    <h3>Objective vs. Subjective Morality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Objective Morality: Some believe that morality exists independently of human opinion—certain things are right or wrong no matter what.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Example: Murder is always wrong, regardless of cultural beliefs.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Subjective Morality: Others argue that morality is a human invention, shaped by culture, emotions, or personal preferences.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Example: What’s considered "moral" varies across societies and historical periods.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>This debate is central to ethics—if morality is objective, how do we discover moral truths? If it’s subjective, can anything truly be called "wrong"?</p>

    <h2>2. Major Ethical Theories</h2>
    <p>Different philosophical traditions have proposed different ways to determine right from wrong. Here are the three major ethical theories:</p>
    <h3>Consequentialism: The Ends Justify the Means</h3>
    <p>In consequentialist ethics, the morality of an action depends on its consequences—if it leads to good results, it's right; if it leads to bad results, it’s wrong.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilitarianism: The most well-known version, founded by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, argues that the best action is the one that maximizes happiness and minimizes suffering.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Example: Saving five people by sacrificing one might be morally justified if it increases overall well-being.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Criticism: Can justify morally questionable actions (e.g., lying, stealing) if they lead to better outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deontology: Rules Matter More Than Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Deontology, championed by Immanuel Kant, argues that some actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of the consequences.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Moral duties and rules define what we should do.</li>
      <li>The Categorical Imperative: Act only in ways that could become a universal law (e.g., don’t lie, because a world where everyone lies would be chaotic).</li>
      <li>Example: It’s wrong to steal, even if stealing food could save a starving person.</li>
      <li>Criticism: Can be too rigid—what if following a rule leads to disaster?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Virtue Ethics: Focus on Character, Not Rules</h3>
    <p>Virtue ethics, dating back to Aristotle, argues that morality isn’t about rules or consequences, but about developing good character traits like courage, honesty, and wisdom.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The goal is to become a virtuous person, not just follow rules.</li>
      <li>Example: Instead of asking "Is lying wrong?" a virtue ethicist would ask, "Would an honest person lie in this situation?"</li>
      <li>Criticism: Lacks clear guidelines for tough decisions—how do we decide what virtues matter most?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these theories has strengths and weaknesses, and many philosophers combine ideas from multiple perspectives.</p>

    <h2>3. Ethical Dilemmas and Real-World Applications</h2>
    <p>Ethical theories may seem abstract, but they play a role in real-world issues, from medicine to technology.</p>
    <h3>The Trolley Problem: Should You Pull the Lever?</h3>
    <p>Imagine a runaway trolley heading toward five people. You can pull a lever to switch tracks, saving them but killing one person instead.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A utilitarian would likely pull the lever to save the most lives.</li>
      <li>A deontologist might refuse, since intentionally killing someone is wrong.</li>
      <li>A virtue ethicist would consider what a virtuous person (e.g., a courageous or compassionate individual) would do.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This thought experiment highlights the conflict between different ethical theories and how difficult moral choices can be.</p>
    <h3>Modern Ethical Issues</h3>
    <p>Ethics applies to many real-world dilemmas, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Medical Ethics: Is euthanasia morally acceptable? Should doctors be allowed to genetically modify embryos?</li>
      <li>AI & Technology: Should AI systems be programmed to follow ethical rules? Who is responsible if an AI makes a harmful decision?</li>
      <li>Environmental Ethics: Do we have moral duties to protect the environment for future generations?</li>
      <li>Business Ethics: Is it ever acceptable for a company to put profit above social responsibility?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ethics isn’t just about hypothetical scenarios—it directly shapes the decisions we make as individuals and societies.</p>

    <h2>4. Can We Be Moral Without Religion?</h2>
    <p>Many moral systems throughout history have been linked to religious beliefs, but is religion necessary for morality?</p>
    <h3>The Divine Command Theory</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Some argue that morality comes from God’s commands—what’s right or wrong is based on divine laws.</li>
      <li>Example: If God says stealing is wrong, then it’s objectively wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Secular Morality: Ethics Without Religion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Others believe we can have morality without religion, basing ethics on reason, human well-being, and empathy.</li>
      <li>Example: Helping others is good because it reduces suffering, not just because a religious text says so.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The debate over religion and morality continues today, shaping discussions on law, human rights, and cultural traditions.</p>

    <h2>5. Why Ethics Matters</h2>
    <p>Ethics isn’t just an academic subject—it influences everything we do.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Personal Life: Ethics guides how we treat others and make decisions about honesty, fairness, and kindness.</li>
      <li>In Society: Ethical principles shape laws, human rights, and justice systems.</li>
      <li>In Global Issues: Debates on war, climate change, and economic inequality all have ethical dimensions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding ethics helps us navigate moral dilemmas, make better decisions, and build a fairer world.</p>
