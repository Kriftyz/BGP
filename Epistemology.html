  <h1>Introduction to Epistemology</h1>
  <p>What does it mean to know something? You might be certain that the sky is blue, that 2 + 2 = 4, or that you’re reading this right now—but how do you know for sure? Could you be mistaken? Could your senses be deceiving you?

Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that investigates knowledge, belief, and truth.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>  It explores how we form beliefs, what it means to be justified in holding those beliefs, and whether we can ever have absolute certainty about anything. These questions aren’t just abstract—they shape the way we think about science, history, law, and even our everyday decisions.

In this section, we’ll explore the fundamental ideas of epistemology, from ancient skepticism to modern theories of truth and knowledge.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>1. What Is Knowledge?</h2>
  <p>At its simplest, knowledge is often defined as “justified true belief”—but this definition isn’t as straightforward as it seems.<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup>  For something to count as knowledge, it must meet three criteria:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It must be true – You can’t “know” something that’s false. If you strongly believe the Earth is flat, that doesn’t make it knowledge.</li>
    <li>You must believe it – You can’t “know” something without actually believing it. If you think 2 + 2 = 5 but guess 4 on a test, you don’t really “know” the answer.</li>
    <li>You must have justification – Knowledge isn’t just guessing correctly; you need a good reason or evidence to support your belief.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This definition, known as the Tripartite Theory of Knowledge, has been debated for centuries, and some philosophers argue that it’s incomplete as showby Gettier's famous counterexamples.<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> Can we ever be fully justified in our beliefs? Is there knowledge beyond what we can prove? These are some of the central debates in epistemology.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>2. How Do We Acquire Knowledge?</h2>
  <p>Where does knowledge come from? Philosophers have proposed several ways that humans acquire knowledge, and these different perspectives shape everything from science and education to law and ethics.</p>
  <h3>Empiricism: Knowledge Through Experience</h3>
  <p>Empiricists argue that all knowledge comes from experience and observation.<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> We learn by seeing, hearing, touching, and testing the world around us. This is the foundation of science, where evidence and experimentation lead us to knowledge.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Key Thinkers: John Locke, David Hume, Aristotle</li>
    <li>Example: You know fire is hot because you’ve felt its heat or seen things burn.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Rationalism: Knowledge Through Reason</h3>
  <p>Rationalists believe that knowledge comes from logic and reason, independent of experience. They argue that some truths are self-evident or innate, meaning we don’t need to experience them to know they’re true.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Key Thinkers: René Descartes, Plato, Immanuel Kant</li>
    <li>Example: You know that 2 + 2 = 4 without needing to touch or observe numbers in the physical world.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Skepticism: Can We Know Anything at All?</h3>
  <p>Skeptics challenge whether we can have any certainty about knowledge. They argue that our senses can deceive us, our reasoning may be flawed, and our beliefs could be false. Extreme skeptics even question whether we can trust our perception of reality itself.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Key Thinkers: Pyrrho of Elis, David Hume, modern postmodernists</li>
    <li>Example: How do you know you’re not dreaming right now? What if all your memories are false?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each of these theories offers a different perspective on how we acquire knowledge and what we can truly know.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>3. Truth and Justification</h2>
  <p>Not all beliefs are equal. Some are backed by strong evidence, while others are based on bias, intuition, or misinformation. But what makes a belief justified?</p>
  <p>Philosophers have proposed different ways of defining truth and justification:</p>
  <h3>The Correspondence Theory of Truth</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Truth is what matches reality. A statement is true if it accurately describes the world.</li>
    <li>Example: “Water boils at 100°C” is true because we can test and observe it.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Coherence Theory of Truth</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Truth is what fits within a consistent system of beliefs.</li>
    <li>Example: A historical claim is true if it aligns with other well-supported historical facts and evidence.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Pragmatic Theory of Truth</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Truth is what works in practice—what proves useful over time.</li>
    <li>Example: Scientific theories are considered “true” as long as they consistently predict and explain phenomena.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each of these views has strengths and weaknesses, and epistemologists continue to debate what truth really means.</p>

    <h2>4. Common Epistemological Problems</h2>
    <p>Epistemology isn’t just about defining knowledge—it also deals with problems and paradoxes that challenge what we think we know.</p>
    <h3>The Gettier Problem: Can You Have Justified True Belief Without Knowledge?</h3>
    <p>Imagine you see a clock that says it’s 2:00 PM, and you believe it. However, the clock is broken and has been stuck on 2:00 PM for hours—you just happened to look at it at the right time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your belief was true (it really was 2:00 PM).</li>
      <li>Your belief was justified (clocks usually tell the right time).</li>
      <li>But did you really know it was 2:00 PM, or was it just luck?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This problem, introduced by Edmund Gettier, shows that justified true belief may not always be enough for real knowledge.</p>
    <h3>The Problem of Induction: Can We Trust Patterns?</h3>
    <figure><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/theseus_0.png" alt="Theseus&#39; Ship Paradox - TV Tropes"></figure>
    <p>Inductive reasoning (learning from past experiences) is how we predict things. If the sun has risen every morning, we assume it will rise tomorrow. But how do we know this pattern won’t suddenly change?</p>
    <p>David Hume argued that induction can never be fully justified—just because something has always happened doesn’t guarantee it will continue to happen.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: A turkey sees a farmer bring food every day and expects it to continue—until one day, the farmer brings an axe.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This raises a big question: Can we ever be certain of anything based on past experience?</p>

    <h2>5. Why Epistemology Matters</h2>
    <p>Epistemology isn’t just about abstract philosophical puzzles—it has real-world implications for science, law, politics, and everyday life.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Science: Epistemology helps define what counts as evidence and proof. The scientific method is built on philosophical ideas about knowledge and justification.</li>
      <li>In Law: Courts rely on epistemology to determine whether eyewitness testimony, expert opinions, or physical evidence are reliable forms of knowledge.</li>
      <li>In Media & Politics: Understanding epistemology helps us recognize bias, misinformation, and unreliable sources of knowledge.<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup></li>
      <li>In Everyday Life: We constantly make decisions based on what we think we know. Epistemology helps us become more critical thinkers and less susceptible to manipulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a world filled with conflicting information, epistemology helps us think smarter, ask better questions, and make more informed decisions.</p>
